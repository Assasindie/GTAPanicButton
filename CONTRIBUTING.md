# How to contribute

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contribution. I welcome all positive changes, including bug fixes and new features. Please read this guide to ensure your contribution is a positive one.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/BradF-99/GTAPanicButton/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've changed. You can read more about pull requests [here.](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting with this project / repository.  
I don't mind if your commits are atomic as this program is pretty small anyway. 

Before contributing, please check the sections below for the type of contribution you intend to create.

#### **Bug Fixes**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Assign me (BradF-99) for review.

#### **New Features**

* You can either send me an email, or:
* Fork the repository, and make your changes. Test them thoroughly.
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the new feature.
* Assign me (BradF-99) for review.

#### **Cosmetic Fixes**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted. However, if you make these fixes along with another contributions then that's totally fine.

#### **Questions about the source code or repository in general**

* Send me an email and I'll be happy to assist!

Once again, thank you for your interest!
