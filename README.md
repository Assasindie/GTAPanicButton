# GTAPanicButton

This program allows you to put yourself in your own GTA:O online lobby by suspending the game process for 10 seconds. This is particularly useful if some *skid hacker* is setting *everyone on fire with their mods* or if you just want some peace and quiet. Your friends will be able to join the session, but other people may join at random due to the match-making algorithm - and of course we can't fix this.

You can also close the game and all of it's processes immediately as well in case you take a **massive L** and don't want to save your progress, for example - if you are trying to complete a heist without dying or something.

The key shortcuts work in game (tested in windowed and fullscreen mode with Windows 10).

This isn't a cheat / hack / menu as it never injects itself in to the game, nor does it modify the game in any way at all. It simply tells the computer to suspend the threads.

I made this in 10* minutes and don't have much intention of changing it.

## Troubleshooting
* *My game freezes!*  
That's the point. Just wait.

* *The software says it can't find the GTA process even though it's open!*  
Try launching the program in administrator mode. I don't know. It's never happened to me before.

* *The program won't open!*
